# Image Processing Techniques

This repository is dedicated to various image analysis techniques used in the field of image processing. It includes implementations and explanations of essential methods such as active contour, blurring, segmentation, edge detection, and histogram analysis. These techniques are fundamental for extracting meaningful information from images, manipulating image data, and enhancing visual content.

## Key Techniques Covered

Active Contour: A method for detecting objects in images based on the contour evolution process.
Blurring: Techniques to reduce noise and detail in images, often used as a preprocessing step.
Segmentation: Dividing an image into multiple segments to simplify or change the representation of the image into something more meaningful and easier to analyze.
Edge Detection: Identifying and locating sharp discontinuities in an image, which are typically associated with object boundaries.
Histogram Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of pixel intensities in an image to understand its contrast, brightness, and intensity distribution.
